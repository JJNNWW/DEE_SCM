# 2. Theoretical Background

## 2.1 Hackathon

The term hackathon is a neologism from the word "hacking" and "marathon" and refers to collaborative software and hardware development events. In recent years, the event format has also gained popularity outside of the hacker community. The goal of a hackathon is to create effective solutions and results in the areas of software development, hardware and open data projects, as well as in business and dealing with global social challenges, in small groups and in a short time. High Definition of the Hackathons are conducted in the fields of Education, Bioinformatics, Marketing, Health Sciences and Big Data. Hackathons are being introduced to generate business ideas and accelerate innovation processes. The four main characteristics of hackathons are the following:

* Participants who are organized in small groups and work intensively 
* A short period in which the project is implemented from concept to prototype 
* A central place where teams meet, work and share resources 
* Assistance by organizers and sponsors in the form of technical equipment, catering and implementation

## 2.2 Blockchain-Technology

“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”  
Don & Alex Tapscott, Blockchain Revolution \(2016\)

There are two different kinds of blockchain technologies. The permissioned and the permissionless type. The permissionless blockchain \(also known as "public"\) has open read and write access and has anonymous actors. The public blockchain is slower than its counterpart. The permissioned, or private blockchain is faster than the permissionless, ahs pre-approved and known participants and permissioned read and write access.

The central component of the blockchain is the incorruptible digital ledger. This means, that the ledger connot be changed, once the transactions are saved in the blockchain. There are methods that ensure that nly valid transactions are saved. This means that the blockchain technology can improve security, authenticity, privacy and accessibility in many different industry sectors. For the energy sector, the blockchain can enable decentralized transactions with lower costs and a very high level of security and confidentiality.

## 2.3 Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract\(scripting\) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.

Ether is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.

Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014. The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins "premined" for the crowdsale. Today, one ether equals about 401€.

## 2.4 Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts based on Blockchain technology enable automatic contracts that take effect on certain events. They do not need human monitoring. A smart contract not only defines the rules and penalties related to an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but it can also automatically enforce those obligations. It does this by taking in information as input, assigning a value to that input through the rules set out in the contract and executing the actions required by those contractual clauses - for example, determining whether an asset should go to one person or should be returned to the other person from whom the asset originated. Smart contracts are complex, and their potential goes beyond the simple transfer of assets - they can execute transactions in a wide range of fields, from legal processes to insurance premiums to crowdfunding agreements to financial derivatives. Smart contracts have the potential to disintermediate the legal and financial fields; in particular, by simplifying and automating routine and repetitive processes for which people currently pay lawyers and banks sizable fees.

## 2.6 Sonstiges

Smart Contract: 3 Varianten

* Ein einzigen smart contract \(einsehbar für alle Parteien\)
* mehrere immer ausführen \(Mehrfacharbeit und Kosten für jeden Contract\)
* mehrere aber nur einen ausführen \(Mehrfacharbeit und Logik komplex welcher auszuführen\)
